              <h2 class="featurette-heading">It all started with increase in Dropouts rate in India  <span class="text-muted"> Here are some reason</span></h2>
              <p class="lead">Dropouts in India are a complex issue influenced by various socio-economic and cultural factors. One primary reason for high dropout rates is poverty. Many families struggle to afford education-related expenses, leading children to abandon school in pursuit of income-generating opportunities. Additionally, inadequate infrastructure, especially in rural areas, results in a lack of access to quality education. Social norms and gender bias also play a significant role, with girls often facing discrimination and early marriage, limiting their educational prospects. Furthermore, a rigid and outdated curriculum, along with a lack of motivation and engagement, fails to keep students interested in their studies. Addressing these multifaceted challenges is essential to reducing dropout rates and ensuring a brighter future for India's youth.

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">The use of the Date from all Institution to moniter dropouts rates<span class="text-muted"> Why there should be a monitoring system </span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Creating a systematic monitoring system for dropout rates in India is imperative for several reasons. Firstly, it provides crucial insights into the effectiveness of educational policies and programs, enabling policymakers to make informed decisions to improve the quality and accessibility of education. Secondly, it helps identify regions and demographics with higher dropout rates, allowing targeted interventions to address disparities and ensure equitable educational opportunities. Additionally, tracking dropout rates facilitates early intervention strategies, such as mentoring and support programs, to retain students in the education system, ultimately contributing to a more skilled and productive workforce. Ultimately, such a system aids in fostering a more inclusive and prosperous society by reducing educational inequalities and enhancing the overall educational landscape in India.</p>

          <p class="lead">There are many students in our country who drops there studies due to some reasons like lack of guidance , unstable economic condition , lack of facilities like institution ,transportation etc. As in this century education is a basic necessities , so our idea is to create a website that gives the ratio of drop out students in categories like age ,region(rural/urban areas) ,gender and more . The website is used to gather information and make Statistics and give the ratios and cause of dropout. It can be access by the schools that means The teacher could update the students details and the reason they due to which they decided to take a drop by knowing that and analysis about the dropout students the higher Authorities of that area would be able to design schemes that will encourage droppers to continue there studies and will help to spread awareness about importance of study ,this website will also provide the scholarship Notification to the student so that they could join the college or schools without financial issues .We made a user-friendly Website so it is easy to be accessed by the User. From this website we provide E-education by top Mentors which will make students interested to study
